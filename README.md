# Papyrus
An ePub parser for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Also has some basic controls to demonstrate displaying ebooks.

## To test
Currently you cannot pick an `epub` file. You can only open a folder. To get a valid folder, simply select an `epub` file and change the extension to `.zip`. Then extract the contents to a folder, which you can then select from the Papyrus demo app.
